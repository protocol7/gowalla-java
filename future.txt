Dumping ground for ideas!

- Provide implementation of RequestHandler that stores data in EHCache (CachingRequestHandler).
- Provide more comparators, where appropriate.
- Missing method calls (created spots, visited spots, bookmarked spots).
  o /spots?l=&checkins_user_id=63589&solr=0&order=checkins_count+desc&limit=20
  o /spots?l=&spots_user_id=63589&solr=0&order=checkins_count+desc&limit=20
  o /spots?l=&bookmarks_user_id=60&solr=0&order=checkins_count+desc&limit=20
- More examples
- More unit tests
- App Engine service that uses GJ and its unit tests to monitor the API for changes (useful for others?)
- "Private" user methods (Notifications, Friend Requests, Current Checkins). Extend FullUser?
  o /users/60/friend_requests
  o /users/63589/notifications 
- URL List of all spots visited: /users/63589/visited_spots_urls ?
- Add Spot criteria arguments to get nearby spots by created, bookmarked, visited.
- Spot Ordering Criteria ???? 
  o &order=checkins_count+desc
  o &order=random()
  o &order=id+desc

Dumping ground for ideas!

- Provide implementation of RequestHandler that stores data in EHCache (CachingRequestHandler).
- Provide more comparators, where appropriate.
- Missing method calls (created spots, visited spots, etc).
- More exmaples
- More unit tests
- App Engine service that uses GJ and its unit tests to monitor the API for changes (useful for others?)
